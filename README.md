# rectorsaurus

The rectorsaurus repo is simply a place for me to test new site design projects.
My basic site will be accessible via http://rectorsaur.us pretty soon, so feel free to visit (once the site is up)!
I'm also building my own web server to house the site on. Fun fun fun.
If you take a look over my code and see something that could have been done easier or better,
feel free to open an issue or message me directly on twitter: @rcrector!
I'm always willing to learn!
