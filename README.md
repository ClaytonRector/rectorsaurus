# rectorsaurus

The rectorsaurus repo is simply a place for me to test new site design projects.
My basic site will be accessable via http://rectorsaur.us, so feel free to visit!
If you take a look over my code and see something that could have been done easier or better,
feel free to open an issue or message me directly on twitter: @rcrector!
I'm always willing to learn!
