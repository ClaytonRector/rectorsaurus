Starting out:
All HTML docs must have <!DOCTYPE html> at the beginning.
<meta charset="utf-8"> — The character set, typically set to UTF-8 to help describe how the page is formatted.
<html></html> — The container or document root for the HTML document.
<style> — The style element can contain CSS code that will be applied to the HTML. Typically it's better to keep CSS in an external stylesheet. (filename.css)
<link></link> — The link element connects other files to an HTML document, such as CSS or JavaScript files.

Common HTML tags:
<title></title> — The title of the document typically appears in browser tabs and search engine results.
<head></head> — code inside here will not be visible to the site visitor. It’s used for CSS, etc., and is a container for meta information.
<body></body> — contains the content and remaining structure of the document.
<header></header> — The header element helps to structure the content. This is different from the head element, which is just for document metadata.
<section></section> — Sections break up logical groupings of information, just like sections of a newspaper.
<footer></footer> — The footer element is a complement to the header element. It represents the bottom of a content area.
<h2></h2> — The second level headline element, similar to first level headlines <h1>. Typically these appear slightly smaller by default.
<p></p> — The paragraph element should contain text in sentence or paragraph form.
<img> — The image element is a self closing element with two required attributes. The source (src) attribute points to the image file and the alternate (alt) attribute describes the image using text.

Common CSS Selectors:
Type Selector - Also known as an "element selector" this CSS selector that isolates all the elements of a given type.

Descendent Selector - CSS selector that selects all the elements of a given type that are nested inside another type of element.
Class Selector - Selects any HTML element that contains a matching class attribute.
:nth-child(An+B) - The nth-child pseudo-class matches A(n)+B-1 siblings in the document tree. The A value that precedes n is required. By itself, this will match every "nth" element in a group. Both A and B must be integers.

CSS Properties:
color - Sets the text color of an element. Accepts any CSS color unit.

background-color - Sets the background color of an element. Accepts any CSS color unit.

list-style - Sets the style of numbers or bullet points for ordered and unordered lists. The marks can also be removed entirely with the value "none".
float - Allows an element to be taken out of the normal flow and placed to the left or right of its container. Text and other inline elements will wrap around it.
clear - The clear property specifies whether an element can be adjacent to floated elements or if it should be moved down and "clear" any floated elements.
background-image - Accepts an image path that applies the file to the background of an element.
